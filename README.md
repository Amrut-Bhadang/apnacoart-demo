My first repositiory

Create a new layer for the background by going to Layers -> New Raster Layer (or New Bitmap Layer depending on your preference).
Use the Paint Bucket tool to fill this new layer with a solid color or pattern.
You can also paste another image as the background by copying it from another source and then pasting it into your Corel PHOTO-PAINT document.
thanks
